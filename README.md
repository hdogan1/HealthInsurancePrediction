# Modeling the Census Bureau Data to Predict the Health Insurance Enrollment Status of Individuals in the United States 
In this project, we predicted the health insurance enrollments in three states via machine learning techniques after President Donald J. Trumpâ€™s executive order to eliminate the health insurance requirements on individuals. We used micro level data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for California, New York and New Jersey since they have the highest urbanization index. We used three classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Neural Network. Our results show that we can predict who will keep insurance coverage and who will not with an accuracy over 90 percent. This will help policy makers and institutions such as hospitals, insurance companies, and pharmacies in making informed decisions related to change in the number of insurance holders in absence of insurance enrollment requirement starting from 2019.
